--I checked our database to see if the problem you describe above was happening for us.  We use Content Caf√© for cover images and have many DVD bib records with ISBNs in addition to 024 fields.  Some of our records have multiple ISBNs and/or multiple 024 fields.  I spot checked some and we have the correct cover art.  You may be facing another issue.

--Here is a query for the Find Tool that will find DVD records that have an ISBN (a subfield a in an 020 field).

Select distinct bi.BibliographicrecordID as ID from Bibliographicrecords bi with (nolock)
inner join BibliographicTags bt (nolock) on (bi.BibliographicrecordID = bt.BibliographicrecordID)
inner join BibliographicSubfields bs (nolock) on (bt.BibliographicTagID = bs.BibliographicTagID)
where bi.RecordstatusID = 1
and bi.PrimaryMARCTOMID = 33
and bt.TagNumber = 020
and bs.Subfield like 'a'

--If these records are showing the correct cover, you may need to investigate further.  If you find that you need to use the method I posted earlier to remove the 020 fields, you can use this query to narrow down your result set and have fewer titles to export, change, and import.
