-- =============================================
-- Author:		Jason Tenter
-- Create date: 2020-08-24
-- Description:	This procedure is for re-opening libraries that were managed by the branch closures process.
--              It reactivates holds, and restores branch hours so that picklists will run properly.
--				It was created during the Covid19 closures, to prevent physical materials being shipped to branches without staff.
